/-! # State events

A standard event signature for stateful computations. The polynomial functor
`StateE σ` has two events:

* `get` — returns the current state of type `σ`.
* `put s` — replaces the current state with `s`, returning `PUnit`.

Together with a `simulate`-based handler interpreting `StateE σ` over `σ`
itself (mapping each `get`/`put` to the corresponding `StateT σ` operation),
this gives the standard "state monad as ITree" embedding.

Coq references:

* `Events/State.v` — `stateE`, `interp_state`, `run_state`.
