# Finite final-sequence approximants (`TypeTree.Chain`)

A `Chain n` presents the `n`-th finite approximant obtained by iterating the
undecorated step polynomial on the terminal object:

```
Chain n ≃ (TypeTree.stepPoly.Obj)^[n] PUnit.
```

Concretely, each successor level carries the current `TypeTree` and a
path-indexed continuation to the next level. Thus `Chain` is a
sigma-friendly presentation of the finite final sequence of `TypeTree.stepPoly`;
it is not a separate protocol language.

Converting to a `TypeTree` via `Chain.toTypeTree` iterates the multiplication of
`TypeTree.substMonoid` (definitionally `PFunctor.FreeM.append`). State-machine
constructions are finite coalgebra unfolds: `Chain.ofStateChain` handles a
stage-indexed state family, and `Chain.ofStateMachine` is its homogeneous
specialization.

## Main definitions

* `TypeTree.Chain` — finite final-sequence approximant of `TypeTree.stepPoly`.
* `TypeTree.Chain.toTypeTree` — flatten via the substitution-monoid structure.
* `Chain.replicate` — constant rounds (recovers `TypeTree.replicate`).
* `Chain.ofStateChain` — finite unfold of a stage-indexed coalgebra.
* `Chain.ofStateMachine` — homogeneous-state specialization.
* `Chain.outputFamily` / `Chain.strategyComp` — dependent state and strategy
  composition along every round.

## Three composition mechanisms

| Mechanism | State? | Path-dependent? | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TypeTree.replicate` | No | No | Uniform rounds (same tree, independent) |
| `TypeTree.stateChain` | Yes (`Stage i`) | Yes | State machine with explicit state type |
| `TypeTree.Chain` | No (baked in) | Yes | Continuation-style, no external state |

These are three views of the same polynomial iteration. `Chain` is the
state-erased finite approximant, `stateChain` is its clocked coalgebra unfold
already flattened to a `TypeTree`, and `replicate` is the constant-coalgebra case.

## Toy examples

The `GrowingMessages` section builds a protocol whose message type grows
at each step (`Fin 1`, `Fin 2`, …) without mentioning any state type.
