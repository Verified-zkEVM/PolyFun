# Pointed machines and sequential composition

A **machine** is a `p`-dynamical system pointed by an initialisation map and
equipped with a partial (Moore) readout:

* `init : α → State` — where the machine starts, given an input;
* `output : State → Option β` — the value read off a state, `none` while running.

This is the interface-agnostic core of VCVio's `OracleMachine` (an oracle
machine is a `Machine` over an oracle spec's polynomial).

## Sequential composition (Spivak–Niu Example 6.41)

`seqComp M₁ M₂ : Machine p α β` runs `M₁ : Machine p α mid` until it produces a
`mid` value, then hands off to `M₂ : Machine p mid β`, over the *same* interface
`p`. Its state set is `M₁.State ⊕ M₂.State` — the "cascading menus" two-phase
machine. This is the structural content of VCVio's `OracleMachine.seqComp` and
the structural half of the sought `IsPolyTime.bind`: the definition (with its
`⊕`-state) is exactly what is currently missing downstream. The complementary
half — the Turing-machine running-time bound for the composed machine — is
computability content that stays in VCVio.

## Fuelled unrolling

`toComp k : State → FreeM p (Option β)` unrolls `k` steps of a machine into a
free-monad program (`none` on fuel exhaustion). It is the deterministic,
interface-generic core of VCVio's `runD` / `toComp`. `toComp_seqComp_inr` shows
the second phase of `seqComp` is faithful to `M₂`; the fuel-exact cross-phase
`bind` law is the next increment.

and recurse on the answer. `none` marks fuel exhaustion. -/

/-- First phase, one step: while in `M₁` (a left state), `seqComp` exposes `M₁`'s
position and, after `M₁`'s update, hands off to `M₂` exactly when `M₁` produces an
output. Together with `toComp_seqComp_inr` this fixes the whole operational
behaviour of the composite: run `M₁`, then run `M₂` from `M₁`'s output. This is
the structural content of the sought `IsPolyTime.bind` (the composite is a
faithful sequential composition); the fuel-threaded single-`bind` form is not a
plain fuel-additive law — `runWith_output_some` supplies the fuel irrelevance it
needs. -/

/-! ## Monad-parametric fuelled run

`toComp` unrolls a machine into the *syntactic* free monad. Interpreting that
unrolling in any monad `m` — via a handler `h : (a : q.A) → m (q.B a)` that
resolves each exposed position monadically — gives the machine a run in `m`. This
is the interface-generic core of VCVio's deterministic `runD` (`m = Option`) and
probabilistic `runK` (`m = SPMF`); the actual ω-limit of the fuel-indexed chain
needs an order/ωCPO on `m` and stays with the concrete instance. The direction
universe is pinned to `β`'s (`q : PFunctor.{uA, u}`) so `FreeM.mapM` applies. -/
