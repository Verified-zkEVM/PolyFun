# Pointed machines and sequential composition

A **pointed machine** is a `p`-dynamical system pointed by an initialisation
map and equipped with a partial (Moore) readout:

* `init : α → State` — where the machine starts, given an input;
* `output : State → Option β` — the value read off a state, `none` while running.

This is the interface-agnostic core of VCVio's `OracleMachine` (an oracle
machine is a `PointedMachine` over an oracle spec's polynomial).

## Sequential composition (Spivak–Niu Example 6.41)

`M₁ ⨟ M₂ : PointedMachine p α β` (`seqComp`, in the book's diagrammatic order)
runs `M₁ : PointedMachine p α mid` until it produces a `mid` value, then hands
off to `M₂ : PointedMachine p mid β`, over the *same* interface `p`. Its state
set is `M₁.State ⊕ M₂.State` — the "cascading menus" two-phase machine. This is
the structural content of VCVio's `OracleMachine.seqComp` and
the structural half of the sought `IsPolyTime.bind`: the definition (with its
`⊕`-state) is exactly what is currently missing downstream. The complementary
half — the Turing-machine running-time bound for the composed machine — is
computability content that stays in VCVio.

## Fuelled unrolling

`toComp k : State → FreeM p (Option β)` unrolls a machine into a free-monad
program that makes at most `k` queries; the readout is free, so at fuel
exhaustion the current output is still read off (`none` marks a machine that is
genuinely unresolved after `k` answered queries). Fuel thereby counts queries
exactly — the `k`-step unrolling resolves precisely when the machine is steady
within `k` queries, the identification that makes steadiness fuel a total query
bound downstream. It is the deterministic, interface-generic core of VCVio's
`runD` / `toComp`. `toComp_seqComp_inr` shows the second phase of `seqComp` is
faithful to `M₂`; the fuel-exact cross-phase `bind` law is the next increment.

law consumes. It is the leaf condition "`toComp k st` has no `none` leaves", and
`resolvesIn_of_toComp_eq_map_some` recovers it from any `some <$> _` factorization
of the unrolling — e.g. from a machine-implements-program equation instantiated at
the syntactic monad `m := FreeM p`, where the run *is* the unrolling. -/

/-! ## Monad-parametric fuelled run

`toComp` unrolls a machine into the *syntactic* free monad. Interpreting that
unrolling in any monad `m` — via a handler `h : (a : q.A) → m (q.B a)` that
resolves each exposed position monadically — gives the machine a run in `m`. This
is the interface-generic core of VCVio's deterministic `runD` (`m = Option`) and
probabilistic `runK` (`m = SPMF`); the actual ω-limit of the fuel-indexed chain
needs an order/ωCPO on `m` and stays with the concrete instance. The direction
universe is pinned to `β`'s (`q : PFunctor.{uA, u}`) so `FreeM.mapM` applies. -/
