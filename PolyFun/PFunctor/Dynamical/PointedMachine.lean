# Pointed machines and sequential composition

A **pointed machine** is a `p`-dynamical system pointed by an initialisation
map and equipped with a partial (Moore) readout. Its state, input, output, and
interface types may live in independent universes:

* `init : α → State` — where the machine starts, given an input;
* `output : State → Option β` — the value read off a state, `none` while running.

This is the interface-agnostic core of VCVio's `OracleMachine` (an oracle
machine is a `PointedMachine` over an oracle spec's polynomial).

## Sequential composition (Spivak–Niu Example 6.41)

`seqComp M₁ M₂ : PointedMachine p α β` runs `M₁ : PointedMachine p α mid` until it produces a
`mid` value, then hands off to `M₂ : PointedMachine p mid β`, over the *same* interface
`p`. Its state set is `M₁.State ⊕ M₂.State` — the "cascading menus" two-phase
machine. This is the structural content of VCVio's `OracleMachine.seqComp` and
the structural half of the sought `IsPolyTime.bind`: the definition (with its
`⊕`-state) is exactly what is currently missing downstream. The complementary
half — the Turing-machine running-time bound for the composed machine — is
computability content that stays in VCVio.

The sum stores only the private operational state of the currently active
phase. Shared runtime resources do not belong in either summand: a handler in
`StateT σ m`, for example, threads the same ambient state through queries from
both phases when the machine is interpreted by `runWith`.

## Fuelled unrolling

`toComp k : State → FreeM p (Option β)` unrolls a machine into a free-monad
program that makes at most `k` queries; the readout is free, so at fuel
exhaustion the current output is still read off (`none` marks a machine that is
genuinely unresolved after `k` answered queries). Fuel thereby counts queries
exactly — the `k`-step unrolling resolves precisely when the machine is steady
within `k` queries, the identification that makes steadiness fuel a total query
bound downstream. It is the deterministic, interface-generic core of VCVio's
`runD` / `toComp`. `toComp_seqComp_inr` shows the second phase of `seqComp` is
faithful to `M₂`; `runWith_seqComp_init` is the fuel-exact cross-phase `bind` law.

/-- Sequential composition of machines over a shared interface (Spivak–Niu
Example 6.41): run `M₁` until it outputs a `mid` value, then run `M₂` from that
value. The state set is `M₁.State ⊕ M₂.State`; phase one never reads out, phase
two carries the final output. As with ordinary monadic bind, only the returned
`mid` value crosses the handoff; information from phase one's private terminal
state must either be returned in `mid` or live in the ambient handler effect. -/

`ResolvesIn k st` says the `k`-query unrolling from `st` reads out on every answer
path — the syntactic finiteness certificate that the sequential-composition fuel
law consumes. It is the leaf condition "`toComp k st` has no `none` leaves", and
`resolvesIn_of_toComp_eq_map_some` recovers it from any `some <$> _` factorization
of the unrolling — e.g. from a machine-implements-program equation instantiated at
the syntactic monad `m := FreeM p`, where the run *is* the unrolling. -/

/-! ## Monad-parametric fuelled run

`toComp` unrolls a machine into the *syntactic* free monad. Interpreting that
unrolling in any monad `m` — via a handler `h : (a : q.A) → m (q.B a)` that
resolves each exposed position monadically — gives the machine a run in `m`. This
is the interface-generic core of VCVio's deterministic `runD` (`m = Option`) and
probabilistic `runK` (`m = SPMF`); the actual ω-limit of the fuel-indexed chain
needs an order/ωCPO on `m` and stays with the concrete instance. For `runWith`,
the direction universe is pinned to `β`'s (`q : PFunctor.{uA, uβ}`) because
`FreeM.mapM` interprets directions and return values in one monad universe. The
machine state and input universes remain independent. -/
