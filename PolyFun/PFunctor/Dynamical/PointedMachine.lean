# Pointed machines and sequential composition

A **pointed machine** is a `p`-dynamical system pointed by an initialisation
map and equipped with a partial (Moore) readout. Its state, input, output, and
interface types may live in independent universes:

* `init : α → State` — where the machine starts, given an input;
* `output : State → Option β` — the value read off a state, `none` while running.

This is the interface-agnostic core of VCVio's `OracleMachine` (an oracle
machine is a `PointedMachine` over an oracle spec's polynomial).

## Sequential composition (Spivak–Niu Example 6.41)

`M₁ ⨟ M₂ : PointedMachine p α β` (`seqComp`, in the book's order) runs
`M₁ : PointedMachine p α mid` until it produces a `mid` value, then hands off
to `M₂ : PointedMachine p mid β`, over the *same* interface `p`. Its state set
is `M₁.State ⊕ M₂.State` — the "cascading menus" two-phase machine. This sum
is the machine-local control state; ambient resources carried by the handler
monad (such as a random-oracle cache or transcript) are shared and threaded
through both phases by the single `runWith`. This is the structural content of
VCVio's `OracleMachine.seqComp` and
the structural half of the sought `IsPolyTime.bind`: the definition (with its
`⊕`-state) is exactly what is currently missing downstream. The complementary
half — the Turing-machine running-time bound for the composed machine — is
computability content that stays in VCVio.

The sum stores only the private operational state of the currently active
phase. Shared runtime resources do not belong in either summand: a handler in
`StateT σ m`, for example, threads the same ambient state through queries from
both phases when the machine is interpreted by `runWith`.

## Fuelled unrolling

`toComp k : State → FreeM p (Option β)` unrolls a machine into a free-monad
program that makes at most `k` queries; the readout is free, so at fuel
exhaustion the current output is still read off (`none` marks a machine that is
genuinely unresolved after `k` answered queries). Fuel thereby counts queries
exactly — the `k`-step unrolling resolves precisely when the machine is steady
within `k` queries, the identification that makes steadiness fuel a total query
bound downstream. It is the deterministic, interface-generic core of VCVio's
`runD` / `toComp`. `toComp_seqComp_inr` shows the second phase of `seqComp` is
faithful to `M₂`; `runWith_seqComp_init` is the fuel-exact cross-phase `bind` law.

/-! ## Machine-implements-program

`Implements M z k` says the machine `M` reproduces the program family `z : α → FreeM p β`
within `k` steps. It is stated at the *free/initial* handler — `M.toComp k (M.init x)`,
the run in the syntactic monad `m = FreeM p` — which pins the machine's observable
behaviour once and universally: by `FreeM.mapM` naturality every concrete handler reads
the same run (`Implements.runWith_eq`, in the `Run` section), so a machine cannot realise
`z` one way for a cost/complexity proof and another for a semantic (e.g. distributional)
reading. This is the interface-generic core of VCVio's `OracleMachine.Implements`. -/

/-- The machine `M` **implements the program family** `z` **within `k` steps**: for every
input `x`, the `k`-step unrolling from `M.init x` is `z x` with `some` at each leaf.
Equivalently — via `Implements.runWith_eq` / `implements_of_runWith_eq` — the run through
*any* handler agrees with the handler's reading of `z`. -/

/-! ## Simulation relations: the practical proof method for `Implements`

A step-synchronized simulation between machine states and program residues discharges
`Implements` by induction on the program. Each machine round consumes exactly one program
`roll` (enforced by `expose_eq`): related `pure` programs read out, related `roll`
programs are unresolved and expose the same position, and updating along any direction
stays related to the continuation. This is the interface-generic core of VCVio's
`OracleMachine.IsSimulation`. -/

/-! ## Monad-parametric fuelled run

`toComp` unrolls a machine into the *syntactic* free monad. Interpreting that
unrolling in any monad `m` — via a handler `h : (a : q.A) → m (q.B a)` that
resolves each exposed position monadically — gives the machine a run in `m`. This
is the interface-generic core of VCVio's deterministic `runD` (`m = Option`) and
probabilistic `runK` (`m = SPMF`); the actual ω-limit of the fuel-indexed chain
needs an order/ωCPO on `m` and stays with the concrete instance. For `runWith`,
the direction universe is pinned to `β`'s (`q : PFunctor.{uA, uβ}`) because
`FreeM.mapM` interprets directions and return values in one monad universe. The
machine state and input universes remain independent. -/
