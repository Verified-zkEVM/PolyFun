# Vertical–cartesian factorization of lenses

Following Spivak–Niu, *Polynomial Functors: A General Theory of Interaction*
(§5.5, Prop 5.51–5.53), this file constructs the vertical–cartesian
factorization of a lens. The orthogonality and lifting laws needed to package a
factorization system are not formalized here. The two classes are:

* **cartesian** lenses — every backward fiber `toFunB a` is a bijection
  (already `PFunctor.Lens.IsCartesian`); and
* **vertical** lenses — the forward map on positions `toFunA` is a bijection
  (`IsVertical`).

Every lens `l : Lens P Q` factors as a vertical lens followed by a cartesian
lens through the middle object `factorMid l = Σ_{i} y^{Q[l.toFunA i]}`:

`P --factorVert--> factorMid l --factorCart--> Q`, with the composite equal to `l`.

The two classes meet in the isomorphisms: a lens is a `PFunctor.Lens.Equiv`
exactly when it is both vertical (`toFunA` bijective) and cartesian (`toFunB a`
bijective), as recorded in `PFunctor/Lens/Cartesian.lean`. That equivalence is
built here as `equivOfVerticalCartesian`, by packaging the position bijection
and the fiber bijections into a `PFunctor.Equiv` and pushing through
`PFunctor.Equiv.toLensEquiv`.

Both classes are closed under the polynomial operations (Spivak–Niu Prop 5.63,
6.88): `IsVertical.sumMap` / `prodMap` / `tensorMap` and `IsCartesian.prodMap`
/ `tensorMap` / `compMap` witness closure under `+`, `×`, `⊗`, and `◃`. Vertical
lenses are *not* closed under the copairing `sumPair` (a `Sum.elim` of two
bijections into a shared codomain need not be injective), so no such witness is
provided.

The downstream consumer is the `LawfulSubSpec` theory in VCVio, where the
cartesian leg is the probability-preserving part of a sub-spec embedding.

The cartesian analogues of the verticality closure lemmas (Spivak–Niu Prop 5.63,
6.88). Unlike positions, the fiber of a product / tensor / composition splits as
a `Sum.map` / `Prod.map` / dependent `Sigma`-map of the leg fibers, so each is a
bijection when both legs are cartesian. -/
