# Examples for two-step systems and machine composition

Regression tests: `twoStep` preserves the state set, `M₁ ⨟ M₂` (`seqComp`) has
`⊕`-state and a faithful second phase, and a concrete halting machine unrolls as
expected.

/-- The two-step system shares its state set with the original, as recorded by
its type: it is literally `Lens.speedup` on the system's lens. -/
example (s : DynSystem S p) : s.twoStep = Lens.speedup s := rfl

/-- The `⨟` notation is diagrammatic sequential composition. -/
example (M₁ : PointedMachine p α mid) (M₂ : PointedMachine p mid β) :
    M₁ ⨟ M₂ = M₁.seqComp M₂ := rfl

/-- Sequential composition has state `M₁.State ⊕ M₂.State`. -/
example (M₁ : PointedMachine p α mid) (M₂ : PointedMachine p mid β) :
    (M₁ ⨟ M₂).State = (M₁.State ⊕ M₂.State) := rfl

/-- The second phase of `seqComp` unrolls exactly like `M₂`. -/
example (M₁ : PointedMachine p α mid) (M₂ : PointedMachine p mid β) (s₂ : M₂.State) :
    (M₁ ⨟ M₂).toComp 3 (Sum.inr s₂) = M₂.toComp 3 s₂ :=
  PointedMachine.toComp_seqComp_inr M₁ M₂ 3 s₂

/-- The first phase exposes `M₁` and hands off to `M₂` exactly on `M₁`'s output. -/
example (M₁ : PointedMachine p α mid) (M₂ : PointedMachine p mid β) (s₁ : M₁.State) :
    (M₁ ⨟ M₂).toComp 1 (Sum.inl s₁)
      = FreeM.roll (M₁.expose s₁) (fun d =>
          (M₁ ⨟ M₂).toComp 0 (match M₁.output (M₁.update s₁ d) with
            | some m => Sum.inr (M₂.init m)
            | none => Sum.inl (M₁.update s₁ d))) :=

  expose := fun _ => PUnit.unit
  update := fun _ _ => PUnit.unit
  init := fun _ => PUnit.unit
  output := fun _ => some b

/-- The readout is free: a halted machine reads off its value at any fuel,
including zero. -/
example (b : β) : (haltMachine (α := α) b).toComp 1 PUnit.unit = FreeM.pure (some b) := rfl

example (b : β) : (haltMachine (α := α) b).toComp 0 PUnit.unit = FreeM.pure (some b) := rfl
